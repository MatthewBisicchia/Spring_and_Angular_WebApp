Deployed on AWS at mydashboard.matthewbisicchia.com

NOTE: If you are going to clone this repository and run this application on your local machine, you first need to add an application.properties file to the backend\programmingChallenges\src\main\resources directory.

This file must specify parameters such as spring.datasource.url, spring.datasource.username, and spring.datasource.password, for example, in order for the backend application to successfully connect to a MySQL database.
